## Extra :

The staff rank is needed to any one who is in the staff or it will be a able to be kick / mute / ban him

The _setup commands is needed , but only once !

The _reset commands will remove all ranks so the server owner will need to reassigne them with _grant

I'm not English so expect some error in my spelling !
